Moving forward:
    Work with other architectures that are already there (spotify API)
    When choosing components to implement, think about what features would prove the value of our product and be a good demo to recruit others
    Get positive feedback to motivate us
    Prototype to find out if people would care
    What could we build by the end of the class that will be a good demo to others.
