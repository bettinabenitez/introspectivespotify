Review Notes for Spotify Listen Class 


Specifications
* Which methods in Spotify Listen will the Input Class call? Should your listening party commands 
by public/external so they’re accessible by the Input Class?
* The document mentions getAccessToken(discord_user_id) will “retrieve the OAuth token specific to 
the user with the necessary access.” Could you clarify what “necessary access” mean? 
* Which Spotify account does !createplaylist make the playlist on? Will there be an Introspective 
Spotify account? Will it make a playlist for all or some of the listening party attendants? Will 
the playlist default to “public” or “secret”? 


Design 
* Libraries
   * Which methods will use the Psycopg2 library? 
* Accessor Methods
   * Why are get_listening party and get_user_list are public? Could they be written as private 
instead?
* Reply Methods
   * What will the format of the message send look like? Perhaps elaborate on how displayqueue() 
will send that message.
* Media control
   * What happens if the user calls the play method before anything is in the queue? Would it be 
possible to play a song without adding it to the queue first? Or have that song play before 
everything on the queue? This functionality may not be necessary for 1.0 release but it could 
something to keep in mind! 
   * Skip will “[select] the song on the queue from the database”. How will this be done? What 
commands will your methods use to “select” from the database? (Note: these questions also apply to 
other methods that require “selecting” from the database)
   * For add, why is name in brackets? Is it a song name or artist name? How do you distinguish the 
name of the song and the name of the artist?
   * For remove, what will happen if you remove a song that is not in the queue? What if the song 
is in the queue twice? Will the remove() remove both occurrences or just one? How will remove() 
search for the song in the database? 
* Private Methods
   * How will queueManagement() keep track of the positions of songs after they are shuffled? 
Should positions be updated when you shuffled? 
   * Why does listeningParty(self) run the skip command? 

Tests
* Black box:
   * What should happen if a user tries to join the listening party but does not a Spotify premium 
account? Should this return an error? Should there be a test for this scenario? 
* White box:
   * It could be helpful to add tests to cover the scenario where we want to add multiple users to 
the listening party.
   * For queue management, should there be a test to handle when all the songs have a status of 2? 
Should there be a test to check the queue when a song is removed? 
   * Could it be helpful to have white-box tests that test music control functions when there is 
only 1 person in the listening party vs when there are multiple people in the listening party?
