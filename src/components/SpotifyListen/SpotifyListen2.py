# THINGS TO DO:
#################

# THINGS TO TRY WITH THE BOT
# REMOVE: check if the trackArtists shows with one artist and multiple


## things to fix about current implementation
# TODO: ppl can't start if there is already a listening party
# TODO: ppl can't add song/skip/etc if there is no listening party
# TODO: !current -> tells u current song 
# TODO: can't find song in addSong should return error message to user

## functionality to add
# TODO: figure out why strings dont fucking work!!!
# TODO: Assign people to roles/groups -> those roles and those people in the listening party this is instead of using the database DEVIKA WILL HELP
# TODO: Prepare for merge    
# TODO: what if you call any of the methods when listening party has not started yet? :(
## another idea: get everyone's spotify ID and play the playlist for everyone. SO pause can finally work :)

##functionality to add now that we have merged
# TODO: do API calls for multiple users?
