# THINGS TO DO:
#################

## MUST FIX: things to fix about current implementation
# TODO: can't find song in addSong should return error message to user
# TODO: fix remove POSITION !!
# TODO: fix get current song in the input class

## MUST FIX/HAVE: ALL THE MERGE RELATED TASKS :OOOO
# TODO: do API calls for multiple users?
# TODO: get everyone's spotify ID and play the playlist for everyone. SO pause can finally work :)
# TODO: write join and leave
# TODO: write end listening party
# TODO: refactor here

## SHOULD HAVE: after we merge tasks
# TODO: refactor here again :( so much to refactor
# TODO: write shuffle

## SHOULD HAVE: functionality to add
# TODO: Assign people to roles/groups -> those roles and those people in the listening party this is instead of using the database DEVIKA WILL HELP

## NICE TO HAVE:
# TODO: vote to confirm removing
# TODO: EMOJI REPLIES
