Computation helper methods
* Edge case - artists with no genre [must fix]
   * During the review meeting, we discussed that the current code does not account for the edge 
case where all the top artists do not have associated genres. Compute_genre or compute_genre_helper 
should definitely be modified to cover this path.  
* Improve the efficiency of compute genre helper [should-fix]
   * We discussed that changing the incrementing variable in compute genre helper to go from 0 to 
limit would improve code efficiency. The variable count is unnecessary.  
Computation methods 
* Remove the auth commands from computation methods [advice] 
   * Because reply methods already take in the Discord user object and because the Spotify object 
in MusicHistory is a global variable, it was suggested that the authorization steps should be moved 
into the reply methods instead of the computation methods. This would prevent redundancy. 
Reply methods
* Move limit error checking into the input class [advice]
   * It was suggested that the input class should handle value errors (for limit variable) instead 
of the reply methods in the Music History component. This would increase component cohesion and 
code readability. 
* Make the exceptions more specific [advice]
   * During the meeting, we discussed that the exception messages should be more descriptive. If 
possible, the exception type should also be stated. 
* Code readability/Comments [should fix]
   * It was mentioned that the current reply methods have very few comments. More comments would be 
incredibly helpful for readers to understand the code.


Overall
* General code clean up [should fix]
   * We discussed that there extra parentheses and print statements in the code. These should be 
removed to clean up the code. Additionally, there is a typo on line 262, where “nice bops” should 
be “nice bop.”
